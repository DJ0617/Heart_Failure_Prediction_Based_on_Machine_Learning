# Heart_Failure_Prediction_Based_on_Machine_Learning
The goal of this machine learning task is to apply three different machine learning algorithms
to the datasets that we chose for the final project. We decided to choose the heart failure prediction dataset from the source
website for our project. The heart failure prediction dataset has 918 nonnull
observations which can be used to classify whether the heart of a patient will fail or not.
